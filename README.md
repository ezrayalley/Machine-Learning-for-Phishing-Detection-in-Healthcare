## 🚀 Features
- **Feature Selection:** Uses correlation and Mutual Information (MI) score to select important features.
- **Model Training:** Compares multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Logistic Regression and Neural Networks).
- **Accuracy Evaluation:** Computes and visualizes Test Accuracy.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for graphical analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
